# Whole Human Brain Ontology

The Whole Human Brain Ontology project constructs a data-driven cell-type ontology of the human brain. This project utilizes [high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.12.511898 ) to build a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and cellular diversity within the human brain.

WHBO aims to construct a robust and hierarchical ontology that organizes brain cell types based on shared gene expression patterns, functional properties, and anatomical locations.
